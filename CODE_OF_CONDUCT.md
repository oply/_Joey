## Code of conduct

Having a Code of Conduct is our way to encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior in our open source community.

* We explicitly forbid harassment and abusive speech within this community.
* We urge participants to refrain from using the community discussion forums to play out a fight.

Harassment, verbal abuse, and fighting harms this community. This Code of Conduct articulates a set of behaviors that support a healthier approach to conflict and interaction.

* **Assume positive intent.** When someone posts something we expect community members will assume positive intent on the part of the post. We may choose to disagree with the idea and reject the suggestion, but we expect that it was made in order to be supportive of the community goals.
* **Respectful to participants.** We expect participants will disagree on aspects of this project. Disagreements must remain professional. Even if we reject someoneâ€™s idea, we continue to welcome their participation. And if your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.
* **Kind to beginners.** Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to to reject code with kindness.
* **Consider your impact on others.** Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.

You are invited to suggest edits, or to edit your own version to suit your needs. We believe codes of conduct improve over time, and like good software, evolve to handle new situations and conditions. Whereas there are already many such codes for various projects, we add our voice to the mix and hope this helps improve the social dynamics that take place in our communities. We are confident you will let us know if you disagree, and we ask that you provide that feedback in accord with the expected behaviors listed above.
